# 🐤 Flappy Bird 2D - Unity Edition

A simple, nostalgic 2D Flappy Bird clone built with Unity. The player taps to fly the bird through a series of pipes—each successful pass scores a point. The highest score is saved using Unity's `PlayerPrefs`.

This game is a small project technically, but it means a lot to me personally. Below, you'll find not just instructions on how to play and download it, but also the story behind why this game matters so much to me.

## 💡 Why I Made This Game

When I was a teenager, I stumbled across a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDIQ17T3sRk&t=41818s&pp=ygUJMTIgY29kaW5n) where a programmer developed a game over 12 hours. I didn’t understand a single thing he was doing, but I was mesmerized. To me, he was like a superhuman. I told myself:  
**"One day, I want to be smart like him. I want to build things like this. I want to write code and become Software Developer."**

Inspired, I found a Flappy Bird tutorial using C# and Windows Forms. I didn’t even know how to install Visual Studio back then. After finally getting it working, I followed the tutorial line by line—literally writing every character by hand, without understanding what any of it meant. I imagined myself as a real software developer, working on a real task.

The game didn’t work. I didn’t know why or how to fix it. But that moment planted a seed. After years of learning and studying software engineering, I’ve come back to that dream—and finally made it real.

This project is the fulfillment of a promise I made to myself back then.
